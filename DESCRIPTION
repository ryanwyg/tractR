Description: tractR provides a simple interface to interact with the U.S.
    Census Batch Geocoder. In particular, the U.S. Census Batch Gecoder restricts
    submissions to 10,000 addresses per call and requires addresses to be formatted
    in a particular order. tractR helps split your data into 10,000 address pieces
    and puts together the API call to the Geocoder.
